National Household Sample Survey - 
PNAD is a survey conducted annually by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE, that focuses on general characteristics of the population, education, work, income and housing. Its last version was made in 2015, when it was then replaced by Continuous National Household Sample Survey - Continuous PNAD.
